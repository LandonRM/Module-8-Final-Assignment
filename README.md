# Module-8-Journal-Questions
This Repository contains all of my project submission documents for part 1 and 2 in a singular document.

The document provided combines both the Part 1 and Part 2 submissions in a singular document, as the instructions specified that it wanted a singular artifact. I am sorry if this isn't exactly as requested, but this is how I understood the submission reqirements.

Here are the questions from the submission guidelines and responses to those questions:
1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
a. The requirements for the full program was to have the list of courses put into it's own class and then having the program allow the user to choose a course, register for that course, and then display both the list of registered courses and the credit hours, ensuring that duplicate courses couldn't happen and that credit hours never go above 9. The user needs that this program is meant to address is allowing for an easy way to register for classes for the upcoming semester.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
a. I believe that I did very well with having my code organized as well as it was. It was easy to read, and while I feel as if I could have done better with comments, I do think the code was organized in a way that made it easy enough to read and figure out what it does.

3. Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
a. The console version had all the courses displayed as a list regardless of what else was shown. The WPF app instead stored the list of courses in a drop down menu and then, once it was registered, shows it in a seperate text box where registered courses were displayed. The regular console app had everything layed one line ontop of another, making ti harder to understand. To make a better user experience with the WPF app, it was required for it to be organized and not have any typing needed from the user, only button clicks. The designs in this sense were successful since it makes it as easy as possible for the user to understand and interact with.

4. How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
a. The process wasn't all to unique on the actual coding portion of the program, as the only thing I thought about when I coded was keeping the code organized and easy to rerad, while making sure it could be expanded on in the future. When it came to getting unstuck on an issue that I was stuck on, I used the method known as rubber duck coding, which was just me talking to a rubber duck on my desk about the code I was working, in the hopes that explaining it to something would allow me to find the solution within my rambling.

5. Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
a. In the final submission of the app, i had to find a way to display a message letting the user know if the course they selected was successfully registered or not, as well as any other errors that may show up. Now in the video within the supporting materials of the submission, it showed the message as part of the application just above the course registered list. I couldn't figure this out and so to ensure that the message could be shown, even if it wasn't in the way that was intended, I chose to have any errors or confirmation messages show up in a pop up message for the user.
