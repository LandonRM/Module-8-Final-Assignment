# Module-8-Journal-Questions
This Repository contains all of my project submission documents for part 1 and 2 in a singular document.

Here are the questions from the submission guidelines and responses to those questions:
1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
a. The requirements for the full program was to have the list of courses put into it's own class and then having the program allow the user to choose a course, register for that course, and then display both the list of registered courses and the credit hours, ensuring that duplicate courses couldn't happen and that credit hours never go above 9. The user needs that this program is meant to address is allowing for an easy way to register for classes for the upcoming semester.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
a. 

3. Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
a. 

4. How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
a. 

5. Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
